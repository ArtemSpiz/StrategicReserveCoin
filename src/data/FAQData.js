    title: "What is SRCOIN?",
    text: "SRCOIN (Strategic Reserve Coin) is a community-governed memecoin on Solana that combines meme culture with Bitcoin-inspired reserve discipline. It features a fixed 1B supply, milestone-based token releases, an on-chain Bitcoin reserve (Satoshi Vault), and three-tier NFT governance.",
  },
  {
    title: "Why buy during presale?",
    text: "Lowest price the token will ever have. Before DEX listings. Before milestones kick in. Before the Vault starts stacking Bitcoin. Early believers get rewarded - that's how this works.",
  },
  {
    title: "What is the Satoshi Vault?",
    text: "Where the Bitcoin lives. Milestone conditions are met → BTC gets bought and held. Not lent. Not staked. Just held. The community watches every move. And presale funds help build this foundation.",
  },
  {
    title: "What happens if milestones aren't met?",
    text: `Tokens burn. Permanently. No emergency vote. No "let's revisit next quarter. " Gone forever. Less supply = your bag gets scarcer.`,
  },
  {
    title: "How does governance work?",
    text: "Three tiers. Lock tokens to earn your seat. Satoshi Guard runs the vault. Nominees handle operations. Voting Members shape proposals. Presale buyers have first shot at securing governance NFTs.",
  },
  {
    title: "How do I know this isn't another rug?",
    text: "Smart contract is audited. Supply rules are hardcoded - no one can mint extra tokens or change the burn logic. Vault reserves are on-chain and visible. We didn't ask you to trust us. We made it so you don't have to.",
  },
  {
    title: "What network is SRCOIN on?",
    text: "SRCOIN is an SPL token on the Solana blockchain. You’ll need a Solana-compatible wallet (like Phantom or Solflare) and SOL for transaction fees.",
  },
  {
    title: "How long is the Satoshi Vault active?",
    text: "The Vault’s annual allocations span 82 years. This isn’t a short-term play. It’s a generational framework designed to outlast any individual contributor or market cycle.",
  },
